# Sentiment Analysis on NYT Articles

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of articles from The New York Times using their [Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview). The goal is to eventually incorporate the sentiment data into a time-series prediction model to analyze trends over time.

2. **Time-Series Prediction**: Use sentiment scores (and potentially other features) to predict future trends or patterns related to the sentiment of the articles.
3. **Deep Learning Integration**: Eventually integrate the model into a deep learning framework for more advanced predictions.
