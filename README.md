# Sentiment Analysis on NYT Articles

This project aims to analyze the sentiment of articles from The New York Times using their [Article Search API](https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview). The goal is to eventually incorporate the sentiment data into a time-series prediction model to analyze trends over time.

## Project Overview

This project consists of several stages:
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Extract articles from The New York Times using the API, process the data, and perform sentiment analysis.
2. **Time-Series Prediction**: Use sentiment scores (and potentially other features) to predict future trends or patterns related to the sentiment of the articles.
3. **Deep Learning Integration**: Eventually integrate the model into a deep learning framework for more advanced predictions.

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-nyt.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-nyt

## API Key

To access the New York Times API, you'll need an API key. Follow these steps to get your API key:

1. Go to the NYT Developer Portal.

2. Sign in or create an account.

3. Request an API key for the Article Search API.

4. Save the API key and store it securely.

To use the API key in your code, you can either:

- Set it as an environment variable:

  ```bash
  export NYT_API_KEY="your-api-key"

Or manually insert it in the script when making requests.

How to Use
1. Fetching Articles from NYT API
Run the script to fetch articles from the New York Times API:

   ```bash
   python fetch_articles.py
This will retrieve articles based on the parameters defined in the script, such as query terms or date ranges. Articles will be saved in a CSV or JSON format for analysis.

2. Sentiment Analysis
Once you have the articles, you can perform sentiment analysis. This is the next step in the pipeline:

   ```bash
   python sentiment_analysis.py
This script will process the articles, extract the relevant text, and analyze the sentiment of each article. Sentiment scores (positive, neutral, negative) will be generated.

## Results  
The output of this project is not yet sure, as it is ongoing development so stay tuned!

## Sentiment Analysis  
The sentiment analysis portion of this project is focused on determining the sentiment of each article based on its content. We use popular natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the articles:  

- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.  
- **Sentiment Classification**: Using pre-trained models or libraries like TextBlob, Vader, or transformers-based models (like BERT) for sentiment classification.

## Next Steps  
- **Time-Series Modeling**: After performing sentiment analysis, the next step is to build a time-series prediction model based on the sentiment scores and other relevant features.  
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Later, we aim to build a deep learning model that can predict trends and patterns based on sentiment analysis and other features.  

Stay tuned for further updates on the deep learning integration!
